-The password is generated Randomly every time the program start.
-To create another password, close and re-open the program.
-To copy the password to clipboard click the first button.
-To save the password, click the second button. (this will create a 'pass.txt' file on the same file the .exe is storaged.)

The program only works if the 'icon2.png' is on the same folder! if an error appear, might be this.

Note from Kiichi:

This is one of my first programs, simple. But i made it simple because it purpose its simple, create and save random passwords. As i walked into some foruns and went trough the Internet, i realised the importance of strong passwords and the inefficience of the creation of them. So i got the idea for this project.
If you are using this software, acknolege the following: i'm very thankful for your support!
